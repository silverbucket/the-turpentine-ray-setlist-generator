## CSS / UI

### Inputs must never be smaller than 16px on iOS

iOS Safari auto-zooms when you focus an `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>`
whose computed `font-size` is below 16px, and it does **not** zoom back out
cleanly afterwards. The user is left with a permanently magnified app until
they pinch-out manually.

**Rule:** every focusable text-style control must have a computed
`font-size >= 16px`. This applies to:

- `<input>` (text, search, email, url, tel, number, password, date, time, etc.)
- `<select>`
- `<textarea>`
- Anything with `contenteditable`

Range, checkbox, radio, file, color, button, submit, reset inputs do **not**
trigger the zoom and can be smaller — but it's safest to default to 16px and
only step down when you have a clear visual reason.

**How:**

- The base rule lives in `src/app.css`:
  ```css
  input, select, textarea { font-size: 16px; }
  ```
- Don't override it lower in component styles. If you must change the size,
  keep it `>= 16px` and add a comment noting why.
- Prefer `font-size: 16px` over `1rem`. If we ever change the root font-size,
  rem-based controls drift below 16px silently.
- Visually-hidden checkboxes inside custom chip/toggle components are exempt
  (they never receive direct focus that triggers zoom), but the visible label
  text still follows normal type rules.

When adding a new input, take 30 seconds to confirm the rendered size in
DevTools' computed styles panel. The bug is silent on desktop and only shows
up the first time someone opens the app on an actual iPhone.
